### "Offensive Powershell" - build your own TCP scanner and password spraying tool in PowerShell

Before we start, let me explain why I have used "offensive Powershell" in the title. Can Powershell be used to create offensive tools? Well, it’s just a scripting language, but it's Turing complete language, thus yes! it can be used for creating any tools, same with other similar scripting languages such as Python, Visual Basic Script or web based JavaScript, not to mention the "proper languages", compiled ones, like C, C++ or awesome C#. It's always about your goals. What I always say, these tools aren't "offensive" but people who use them and their intentions can be as productive as destructive! You must have heard about tools like MetaSploit (written in Ruby) which helps security and IT professionals identify security issues, verify vulnerability mitigations and providing true security risk intelligence or PowerShell Empire, post-exploitation framework written in PowerShell.

These tools are used by Red Teams and Pen-Testers to identify vulnerabilities and make your system more secure in general, but “every stick has two ends” and there will always be some evil mind, who will want to exploit your network with these smart programs I mentioned before.

Thus, with Powershell, possibilities are limitless!
